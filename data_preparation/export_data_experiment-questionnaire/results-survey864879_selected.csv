If the code is longer than just a few rows (eg for a website with multiple videos -> learning path), the natural language helps for better understanding and debugging the code as it is easy to understand when an object gets declared or a an attribute set. In comparison, the Key-Value Notation looks the same in the beginnng and one has to ready the full line to understand what is done with the object (timestamp, video...).
Furthermore, if one has experience with SQL, Python etc., it feels more logically as it reminds of object oriented programming (with classes and attributes).";"4";"5 - strongly agree";"4";"5 - strongly agree";"";"Yes"

As soon as I have the instruction flow by heart, I mostly know what to do with the natural-language notation as the script is more or less the same for all parts - ""id"", ""title"", ""body"". Also, since I'm a person with typo all the times, key-value notation may make it harder for me to find the typo.
