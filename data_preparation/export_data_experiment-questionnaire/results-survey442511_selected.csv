As discussed, I also wonder what would happen if you need to create more than 1 module. You might need to assign an ID in that scenario?

2. In ""question"", the word ""question"" is used both as a classname and as keyword, this might confuse some users. I would suggest changing the key name to ""body"" or something similar. Also, the structure of the answer key where text strings are interchanging with boolean wrong/correct values may lead to confusion and errors, I would suggest using some nested key-value structure there, e.g. question q1 answers ((""Wrong answer"", wrong), (""Correct answer"", correct)).

While this notation is more similar to imperative programming languages, where one actively ""creates"" objects and ""sets"" their properties, the attempt to make it sound more like a natural language with the excessive use of ""with"", ""of"", ""which is"", etc. makes the script so ridiculous that I would be more happy with something completely ""technical"" like v1.url=""youtube.com/something"" rathet than ""Set URL of v1 to youtube.com/something"".";"2nd place";"1st place";"The key-value notation is a declarative one, and this is no surprise it is more convenient for creating static content like such learning modules, look back at HTML, which is also declarative and has been used successfully to structure web pages for the last 3 decades.

The ""natural-language"" notation looks like an imperative programming language with an excessive amount of prepositions and rather weird word order, which in my opinion takes the worst from both worlds: imperative programming languages and natural languages. First, in contrast to the argument I had for the key-value notation, one would seldom use an imperative programming language to create content manually. It does makes sense to use it for automated content generation, e.g. you have a ready database with video URLs, course titles and texts and you want to automatically generate similar web pages for them, but for a case where every page is to some extent uniquely handcrafted it is just a massive overkill. Second, the attempt to make it sound more like natural language did not work out nicely in my opinion. While I clearly see the purpose behind it, which is to make the language more appealing to non-technical users, the excessive usage of prepositions like ""of"", ""with"", etc. just makes the text look clumsy.

It would also be nice if the identifiers (e.g. ""URL"", ""title"") were colored, just to give the user a confirmation.

Other than that, it was really easy to navigate the tool and everything was clear. I finished successfully and I didn't find it difficult. My first general impression however is that it might be nice to have some interactive elements, for example: drag a box titled ""video"" into the storyboard editing field (bottom left box) which will automatically insert the code. It will then prompt you to insert a title, if you want timestamps, etc. This might be more intuitive and faster than writing code.

One minor point: YouTube videos are typically measured in minutes:seconds, so converting a time to seconds for the key value is a bit of a pain (and less efficient), in contrast to clicking on the time bar.

The questions order in the generated module preview is different to the one that was entered in the code. It would be nice to be able to check if the assignment of wrong and correct works. Not sure if that was possible.

In general, I have a good impression. The availability of the accelerators in terms of suggested code words is a great time saver.";"experiment98";"11:27";"2";"nl";"2";"4";"2";"2";"3";"2";"3";"3";"3";"2";"Since there are a lot of text in this ""language"" it would be nice to be able to copy and paste stuff from the Help.
Help is inconsistent and is confusing sometimes.
When I was trying to name the textpage as tp, the program kept substituting tp with textpage. So, after a few tries I had to name the textpage as tp1. That was a bit frustrating.
In general, I like the first version better than this one, because there was less text to type. I finished this task faster because I had practice with the first assignemnt.

Due to the natural language constructs it was a little bit more difficult to remember how to write the statement. E.g. the ""wich is"" part of Questions.
I dont know the other commands available in this notation, but i would suggest to create a language with only few but consistent keywords (e.g. ""which is"" is also used in an ""if"" statement).
It was also more cumbersome, since i had to write more words.";"2nd place";"1st place";"For me as a person with experience in C++ Programming, the simpler notation gets a higher rank. For me it is easier to use and to read. But thats due to my experience with programming languages.

However, i think the natural language version, like a higher programming language, could be more effective, when it comes to more complex and more modularized Systems. That is, if more keywords are added to the language, then you have standardized keywords like ""create"", you allready know and do not need to learn the syntax. In addition, when the system allows to add libraries or modules to integrate new functionality, then a collection of standardized keywords is necessary. Otherwise a library is always introducing new commands, which one needs to learn, making it unusable.";"3";"3";"3";"5 - strongly agree";"";"No"
