1. The instructions were quite cramped. If the steps would have been in a bullet point list, I might have been able to follow them better. One of the reasons for spending a few extra minutes on the task was due to having to jump between windows (instruction/documentation/script), which made me lose the trail of thought. 

2. The text editor is quite simple in its functionality. The auto-completion was present but limited. There was no apparent way of commenting on lines of code, and the error message was very basic.

3. The documentation pop-up window was obstructive. I tried different window sizes, yet the pop-up window was always on top of the text editor. This made it challenging to write as it was hiding part of the text.

4. I am unsure how this way of creating storyboards is better than a more drag-and-drop interface. I wished I could simply click on the buttons from the documentation section and instantly get the line of code corresponding to that command. 
The NLP part is only marginally improving the readability of the script, but it yet resembles a lot of a high-level interpreting language like Python. Writing letter by letter (a limitation of the text editor) makes it more cumbersome than useful.

5. I am curious to see how this tool will evolve. It seems to be at a beta stage, and many more established features from other IDEs could be implemented. ";experiment64;09:17;2;kv;3;3;3;3;4;3;4;4;3;3;"The second round was easier as I simply got the gist of using the interface and hopping between documentation and instructions. However, I lost some precious time (;) joking) as I copy pasted a snippet of text at the end of the script that I did not see as the text editor does not allow full-screen preview mode. It took me some time to figure out where the error was as the error message did not indicate which line to look.

However, the second time was much more fun.

for setting the video URL and title etc. i think that the text-based approach is more efficient. it is also easier to see mistakes and adjust them. thus, making the tete-based approach also more effective for this.
