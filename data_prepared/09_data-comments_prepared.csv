"1",1,19613739,35,35,"Since there are a lot of text in this ""language"" it would be nice to be able to copy and paste stuff from the Help.
Help is inconsistent and is confusing sometimes.
When I was trying to name the textpage as tp, the program kept substituting tp with textpage. So, after a few tries I had to name the textpage as tp1. That was a bit frustrating.
In general, I like the first version better than this one, because there was less text to type. I finished this task faster because I had practice with the first assignemnt.
","There were some inconsistencies in the Help section. For example, in the video example the id of the video was long (do not remember the exact phrase), however, in the example for the module the id of the video was changed to just video and not the id from the previous examples, whereas other ids were kept as in their examples. So, this is a bit confusing.

The questions order in the generated module preview is different to the one that was entered in the code. It would be nice to be able to check if the assignment of wrong and correct works. Not sure if that was possible.

In general, I have a good impression. The availability of the accelerators in terms of suggested code words is a great time saver.","See the feedback in previous section.",""

- why is upper case mandatory?","Positive notes:

+ easier to learn

Negative
- not human readable
- notation might need background information/experience in programming","- easier to learn the syntax, less syntactical details","The answers here are subjective, i.e., I personally have experience with programming and markup languages, etc.

"7",7,138148317,32,32,"Some code lines appear a bit long... this can be cumbersome in daily use. There are lot of repetitions needed; maybe an additional auto-completion (or suggestions/recommendations) would help.
I like the autocompletion suggestions. Also the examples help.","easy to use.
reminds me a bit of the syntax for markdown as used in hugo (for websites)

i like that it is quite short

auto-complete for syntax would be useful. e.g., for instance if a line starts with ""video"", then there are several options for attributes such as ""title"" or ""URL"" - these could be suggested.","the key-value notation is far shorter. making it more concise.
the N-L notation is long. and it is easy to forget a part. first create, then set,... etc. it makes it lengthy, which is unnecessary complex (to read the code afterwards; also to find an error)","i think text-based and GUI should be combined from the beginning so that a user can switch whenever wanted. drag and drop can be very useful. also for adjusting the order, drag and drop can be very handy if only slight changes are needed. for a completely different order, the text-based approach is more handy.

for setting the video URL and title etc. i think that the text-based approach is more efficient. it is also easier to see mistakes and adjust them. thus, making the tete-based approach also more effective for this.

if everything needs to be done with the text-based approach, I am not sure if it will lead to a lot of mistakes (e.g., missing something) if done for a lot of videos. but using code excerpts as templates for a lot of modules could be very useful. (both for efficiency and effectiveness)"
"9",8,151743211,28,28,"This natural language notation was more intuitive to use and therefore is faster. I finished ""successfully"" within 22 minutes, because I was stuck on an error for 15 minutes. The error feedback (""extra characters after close-quote"") wasn't helpful, as it didn't tell me what line this was on and actually mislead me to looking for the error in the wrong places. 

The actual mistake I made was I used the wrong syntax for the answers of the question. I used a notation similar to that of the first experiment: ""Set answer of q1 to (""Answer 1"", correct ""Answer 2"", wrong) instead of: ""Set answer of q1 to ""Answer 1"" which is correct, Set answer of q1 to ""Answer 2"" which is false"". This was simply a mistake on my part and not due to a flaw of the natural language notation. I believe that now I would be more confident and also faster using this notation over the previous one!","The information windows that pops when clicking the buttons (e.g. ""Video"", ""Question"") covers a part of the code and the window isn't moveable. It would be nice to be able to drag the window.

It would also be nice if the identifiers (e.g. ""URL"", ""title"") were colored, just to give the user a confirmation.

Other than that, it was really easy to navigate the tool and everything was clear. I finished successfully and I didn't find it difficult. My first general impression however is that it might be nice to have some interactive elements, for example: drag a box titled ""video"" into the storyboard editing field (bottom left box) which will automatically insert the code. It will then prompt you to insert a title, if you want timestamps, etc. This might be more intuitive and faster than writing code.

","As stated previously, i find the natural-language notation to be more intuitive and therefore faster to use.","I feel like the combination of a GUI and textual notation is the best. The GUI would be good for creating the main structure of the module (what goes where, how big should the textfield or embedded video be, etc). And the textual notation would be good for further refinements (e.g. creating the question/answer form, setting title of elements, etc). You should be able to switch between GUI and textual notation in my opinion!"

One can just click on the commands from the help section and they are typed in the command line. When one clicks, the modal window opens with the suggestion of what to create with what attributes. Could be helpful maybe for people who are afraid of code in general and prefer visual.","I personally can work with both.",""
"25",20,648261524,26,26,"I found this natural language notation more cumbersome than the first one. It seemed less consistent, I felt that I had to use unnecessary adverbs, it was more spurious and not as easy to remember. If I 'program' a script, a 'real' programming language with a clear structure would feel more natural and easier to learn and remember (without having to constantly refer to the example scripts).","The syntax is easy and consistent enough. Particularly the examples in the help section are helpful for just copying without having to think about the syntax myself.","Both key-value notation and natural-language notation are easy enough, but the key-value notation is more consistent and easier to memorize (at least to me). I have limited programming experience, but I do program my lecture slides in Latex, as I find this far more easier than drag-and-drop in PowerPoint.","I find video editing (in Linux with KdenLive) quite cumbersome and find it hard to work with the graphical timeline. For me, a programming approach would work much better. Also, I could more easily scroll back to check whether I defined all the timepoints and other things that I wanted to define (it gives me a better overview).

In terms of logic, it struck me as odd that I was allowed to already add material to the video before I defined them. In programming, using or referring to variables before you defined them, is strongly discouraged. I also think that for humans it is more logical to first define/create all items and then integrate them."
"28",21,724297500,33,33,"The 3 main commands make programming easier, as they provided a standardized way to work. 
I wonder if the ADD command could be used to structure the module: I was expecting this. 
I still suggest to use colors in order to distinguish attributes (blu) and values (green for numbers, red for text strings).","I think there are some differences between commands, e.g. for pages I have the title command, which is not contempleta for video: repetition and patterns make it easier to use the language. Also, I found the use of color could help.
I started the task trying to only remember the syntax, but I have to check some commands. I made a mistake at the beginning, as I wrote commands with capital letter, and the feedback was too vague.

"29",22,752975415,23,23,"I liked the task before more, it was easier for me to use. Again with the help of the buttons in the right upper corner this one was also not hard to finish, but somehow I did not liked the task that much, than the one before. I hope that I finish successfully, it looked right to me. My general impression of it is that it's more complicated than the one before and uses a lot more ""words"".","It was fun for me to do this task. I think with the button in the right upper corner and the video before it was easy to solve. I think everyone, even without any programming language experience would be able to solve it. It was very well explained. Although I finished it in around 12 minutes I felt a little time pressure, that's why I got 2-3 errors, because of typos before submitting it (hopefully?) correctly. I think in comparison to other programming languages it was very clear how to solve it and I didn't got confused. ","For me the Key-Value Notation was easier to use and everything was very clear. I could in fact imagine working with both but I simply liked the Key-Value Notation more. I think I would also be quicker using this one than the Natural-Language Notation. ",""
"30",23,811855564,12,12,"interesting experience, quite easy to understand. What confused me at first is that functions (Create, Set, Add) are case-sensitive, but ""types"" like video, timestamp etc. are not, even though they start with large letters in the help box. 
However, as programmers are usually lazy and to avoid irrelevant errors when compiling, I would prefer as less case-sensitive commands as possible.","it was also quite easy and understandable. For such a simple task it is more efficient and consistent to write, but not that easy to read and understand. In once case there is a unnecessary ambiguity: <question ""id_question"" question ""this is the question""> shows that it is not as clear as <Set question ""id_question"" to ""this is the question"">","It feels more natural, easy to understand even after not looking at it for several hours/days/weeks.
If the code is longer than just a few rows (eg for a website with multiple videos -> learning path), the natural language helps for better understanding and debugging the code as it is easy to understand when an object gets declared or a an attribute set. In comparison, the Key-Value Notation looks the same in the beginnng and one has to ready the full line to understand what is done with the object (timestamp, video...).
Furthermore, if one has experience with SQL, Python etc., it feels more logically as it reminds of object oriented programming (with classes and attributes).",""
"32",24,1041534481,13,13,"I finished successfully and the notation was actually really hopefully to find my errors otherwise I probably wouldn't have found the error on my own.","i finished successfully this time even faster. its really easy to use this notation once you get familiar with it","I think the key-value is easier to use because there isn't so much text so you can have an better overview than with the other notation. its just that you are more likely to make mistakes with the natural -language than with the key value.",""
"33",25,1082741466,27,27,"Although my answers may be biased as at this point I am implicitly comparing the ""natural-language"" notation with the key-value notation, in general my experience with the ""natural-language"" one is rather unpleasant. While the usage of ""create"" vs ""set"" commands at least makes sense, the sudden introduction of the ""add"" command is really confusing. Why does one ""add"" timestamps to the video but does not ""add"" answers to question, for example?
While this notation is more similar to imperative programming languages, where one actively ""creates"" objects and ""sets"" their properties, the attempt to make it sound more like a natural language with the excessive use of ""with"", ""of"", ""which is"", etc. makes the script so ridiculous that I would be more happy with something completely ""technical"" like v1.url=""youtube.com/something"" rathet than ""Set URL of v1 to youtube.com/something"".","In general, I enjoyed the editing process very much. I think the syntax is very well-thought. However, I have a couple of suggestions:
1. In ""video"", the URL key is upper-case while all other keys are lower-case, why not just keep the url key lower-case as well? Also, it would be nice for consistency and probably security to enclose the URL value in parentheses in the same way as strings.
2. In ""question"", the word ""question"" is used both as a classname and as keyword, this might confuse some users. I would suggest changing the key name to ""body"" or something similar. Also, the structure of the answer key where text strings are interchanging with boolean wrong/correct values may lead to confusion and errors, I would suggest using some nested key-value structure there, e.g. question q1 answers ((""Wrong answer"", wrong), (""Correct answer"", correct)). (Maybe there is an even better way to do it). While it would make the notation more complicated, it will be more structured, which will be beneficial to some users.","The key-value notation is a declarative one, and this is no surprise it is more convenient for creating static content like such learning modules, look back at HTML, which is also declarative and has been used successfully to structure web pages for the last 3 decades. It just feels natural.
The ""natural-language"" notation looks like an imperative programming language with an excessive amount of prepositions and rather weird word order, which in my opinion takes the worst from both worlds: imperative programming languages and natural languages. First, in contrast to the argument I had for the key-value notation, one would seldom use an imperative programming language to create content manually. It does makes sense to use it for automated content generation, e.g. you have a ready database with video URLs, course titles and texts and you want to automatically generate similar web pages for them, but for a case where every page is to some extent uniquely handcrafted it is just a massive overkill. Second, the attempt to make it sound more like natural language did not work out nicely in my opinion. While I clearly see the purpose behind it, which is to make the language more appealing to non-technical users, the excessive usage of prepositions like ""of"", ""with"", etc. just makes the text look clumsy. On top of that, the word order required to make it sound more natural, i.e. set attribute of id to value, just hurts a programmer's eye a bit.","The comparison of the two notations is yet another instance of the somewhat classical declarative vs imperative debate. Are there no existing studies on which one fits better for the purpose? "
"34",26,1137248348,27,27,"I am not at all accustomed to use notations like this, but the video tutorial explained very well how to use it and the explanations and examples in the editing board itself were very helpful. Well, to be honest I just followed the instructions step by step and used the examples in the editing board menu to fulfill the task in an analogous manner. Without these examples I would not have been able to get started at all. So I wonder, how I would use the notation system to create anything that differs from what is explained and shown in the editing board...","For the second task I needed half of the time compared to the first task. This is mainly due to the fact that I learned a lot from working on the first task.
I see that the key-value notation is also quicker to use because you need to type less text.
Nevertheless I find both notation formats equally easy or complex to use. In both cases I followed the instructions step by step and used the examples to complete the task in an analogous manner. It was not problem for me to do this. But in both cases my concern is, how I could use the notation system to create content that differns from what is shown in the examples...","As already commented, I find both notation formats more or less equally easy or complex to use. 
But the advantage of the key-value notation is, that you have to type less text, so you save time and it is less error-prone.","For me it was the first time to use a notation system like this and I don´t have any experience with programming, so I am not very confident.
But I think if I used such a notation system more often and if it would be combined with a GUI representation, I could get accustomed to it. Especially if there are very easy step by step explanations with examples how to use the tool, like in this case.
In the end, I think it is a very interesting tool!"

I also noticed that in the instructions there once was the word ""Add"" but I had to use the command ""Set"". So this was a little bit confusing.

The Natural-Language Notation shows the structure better, the key-value Notation is more simplex and more easy to use though.","It is helpful to have a formula in an GUI (e.g. moodle) that helps with the usability but it is also very helpful (e.g. for e-developers) to see the coding behind in such an editor. It it often easier to change things in the Notation."
"48",36,1570536953,20,20,"From my experience, I think it was really easy to use. The window with 'example code' helped a lot when I forgot what to do. From the tutorial, I also knew where to look for help. However, if the person wants to do something more complex than just adding questions and videos and have no prior coding experience I think it could be a bit difficult to use and technical support would be needed in that case.","Maybe, it would be worth exploring 'drag and drop' options? It would be nice to have it in the 'help window' and just fill the necessary data, I think it would be much faster to create the modules, especially for people with no coding experience. Or at least to have a possibility to copy the code from the help window. Also, the autofill for some commands is not working which makes it prone to typos which I personally always struggle with. Anyway, this variant of the language was much clearer than the previous one.","I think Key-Value is much clearer to use, the body of the code is not so crowdy.

I am not very experienced in programming and it was really easy for me because of how everything was well explained.

"53",40,1711638257,28,28,"I found the following:
1. The instructions were quite cramped. If the steps would have been in a bullet point list, I might have been able to follow them better. One of the reasons for spending a few extra minutes on the task was due to having to jump between windows (instruction/documentation/script), which made me lose the trail of thought. 

2. The text editor is quite simple in its functionality. The auto-completion was present but limited. There was no apparent way of commenting on lines of code, and the error message was very basic.

3. The documentation pop-up window was obstructive. I tried different window sizes, yet the pop-up window was always on top of the text editor. This made it challenging to write as it was hiding part of the text.

4. I am unsure how this way of creating storyboards is better than a more drag-and-drop interface. I wished I could simply click on the buttons from the documentation section and instantly get the line of code corresponding to that command. 
The NLP part is only marginally improving the readability of the script, but it yet resembles a lot of a high-level interpreting language like Python. Writing letter by letter (a limitation of the text editor) makes it more cumbersome than useful.

5. I am curious to see how this tool will evolve. It seems to be at a beta stage, and many more established features from other IDEs could be implemented. ","The second round was easier as I simply got the gist of using the interface and hopping between documentation and instructions. However, I lost some precious time (;) joking) as I copy pasted a snippet of text at the end of the script that I did not see as the text editor does not allow full-screen preview mode. It took me some time to figure out where the error was as the error message did not indicate which line to look.

However, the second time was much more fun. ","Although the differences were subtle, I found the key-value notation way more succinct and intuitive. ","I think the tool is at a promising start, and through cycles of iterations and incremental improvements in the UI, the IntelliSense, and the language, it could be useful in the near future. "
"56",41,1774807342,38,38,"This notation is focused on actions instead of elements. It is also relatively easy to use, but not as easy as the first one.","Notation is well designed and easy to use. However some commands could be grouped together to avoid possible errors with wrong IDs (e.g. title + body).","Both notations are easy to use, however I think that programming experiece is more important for the key-value notation. Therefore, with the first one a broader audience can be addressed.","I would prefer to start with a GUI for the first draft and to do a ""fine tuning"" with the textual notation."

"60",45,1832679888,37,37,"It was ok. Due to the natural language constructs it was a little bit more difficult to remember how to write the statement. E.g. the ""wich is"" part of Questions.
I dont know the other commands available in this notation, but i would suggest to create a language with only few but consistent keywords (e.g. ""which is"" is also used in an ""if"" statement).
It was also more cumbersome, since i had to write more words.","I missed some sort of code-completion or keyword suggestion features like in many programming EDIs.","For me as a person with experience in C++ Programming, the simpler notation gets a higher rank. For me it is easier to use and to read. But thats due to my experience with programming languages.

However, i think the natural language version, like a higher programming language, could be more effective, when it comes to more complex and more modularized Systems. That is, if more keywords are added to the language, then you have standardized keywords like ""create"", you allready know and do not need to learn the syntax. In addition, when the system allows to add libraries or modules to integrate new functionality, then a collection of standardized keywords is necessary. Otherwise a library is always introducing new commands, which one needs to learn, making it unusable.",""
